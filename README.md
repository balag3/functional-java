Exercises for training FP with Java

This is a training ground for exercising functional programming with Java, assisted by TotallyLazy.

Java 8 SDK is required.

Each section contains tests that you can use to verify your implementation.

### Recursion, Collections and Higher order functions

These are located in exercises-package. They cover some of the basic but essential topics of functional programming. Implement methods marked with TODO-comment and run tests to see if your implementation works correctly.

### Project Euler problems

Have a look at the euler-package. Problem32 is an example solution with comparison to an imperative solution. 
More exercises without solutions will be added to that package for training later on.

### Tests

Make sure you are using Java 8 SDK. Then run `./gradlew test`
